      Hi this in this column you will get to know a little about me. I love to call myself An Acrylic artist now.
      So what was I even before I became an Artist, I am an Engineering Gradute from Puducherry, India. 
      I have a year of experience in the IT industry, Tech Mahindra Chennai, India.

      Before my college I was soo good at sports, Basketball and also dance, Fusion and our very own Classical Bharathnatiyam.
      During my college I wasn't really sure about the domain I chose which was Electronic and Communication Engineering.
      But as semesters passed I started enjoying it. But we had very minimal opportunies in our small town, so I chose IT.
      
      I got married a year later after my Joining in the company due to which I had to relocate to Bangalore, India.
      Then started my career break until now.
      
      Slowly I started getting back on my feet and was ready to end my career break, but then Covid struck the entire world which
      led me an another field: Painting. I started painting as a stress buster but eventually started liking which led to Love :).
      2.5 years of painting gave me the confidence in exploring new world as a Freelancer and commissioned artist.
      I have put up stalls, collaborated with artists in Instagram. 2022 was a year full of surprises and independence for me. I stayed at my 
      paternals home and made many paintings sold mmany art piece. Later we had to move to USA for my husband's job which didnt go easy on me.
      I do paintings here but not as much as I did back in India.

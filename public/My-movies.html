<h1>The Best Movies According to Bhuvaneswari</h1>
<h2>My 3 Favorite movies recently</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ponniyin Selvan</h3>
<p>Directed by Indian top director Mani Rathinam. This movie is based on a Novel Ponniyin Selvan</p>
<h3>Leo</h3>
<p>This is my Favorite because I like the actor and also for the fact he went out of comfort zone a tried a different story. The biggest talk is LCU which is like different movies directed by the same director Lokesh Kanagaraj and all these movies make a big story.
</p>
<h3>Ayalaan</h3>
<p>This movie is a fun and happy movie made especsially for kids. Its based on an alien who ends up in Earth and has all the fun with his human friends</p>
